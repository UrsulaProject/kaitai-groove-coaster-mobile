# GrooveCoaster 2 Mobile Tools

The original intent of these was to create tools to unpack and repack the .dat files so we could mod the game. But apparently someone else has beat me to it. So I'm just going to leave this here for anyone who wants to use it.

# .idc
The .idc are (partially )hand-reconstructed from:
```
md5sum libtune.so
25e2763748e43c32d4f079c1c9c5c4f2  libtune.so
```

The remaining fields (mostly) requires comparing the live game to understand the purpose of each field, which is too much work
